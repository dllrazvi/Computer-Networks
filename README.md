# Computer-Networks
This repository contains multiple practical projects and simulations for the Computer Networks course, focused on designing and configuring complex network topologies using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview of Work
### In these projects I worked on:

- Designing multi-router topologies with subnetting based on given IP ranges and masks

- Dividing networks into logical subnets with specific IP allocations (e.g., /25, /24)

- Configuring devices such as:

- Routers (R1-R8) with static routing or dynamic routing protocols

- Switches and Access Points

- Servers: DNS, DHCP, Web Server

- End Devices: PCs, Laptops, Smartphones

- Setting up and testing:

- DHCP configuration and automatic IP assignment

- DNS server functionality

- Web server accessibility

- Wireless connectivity via access points

- Addressing practical constraints like limited IP ranges and ensuring correct IP distribution

## Key Learnings
- Strong understanding of subnetting, IP planning, and address distribution

- Hands-on practice with network routing logic and multi-device setups

- Configuration of realistic enterprise-like network environments

- Working with both wired and wireless devices in simulations

- Verifying connectivity and network performance using simulation tools inside Packet Tracer
